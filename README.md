# Demo Project: Android Screenshot Testing

This project is a demo for my bachelor's thesis defense on Android screenshot testing.
The tool of choice is Roborazzi. Git LFS is used for storing and versioning screenshots.
The screenshot tests also run in the CI/CD pipeline.

The relevant commits can be seen on the branch `presentation`.
